    "# Tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This guide assumes you have installed QIIME 2 using one of the procedures in the [install documents](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/install/) and have installed [q2-deicode](https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/q2-deicode).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to interpret and perform Robust Aitchison PCA through QIIME 2. The focus of this tutorial is compositional beta diversity. There are many beta diversity metrics that have been proposed, all with varying benefits on varying data structures. However, presence/absence metric often prove to give better results than those that rely on abundances (i.e. unweighted vs. weighted UniFrac). One component of this phenomenon is the interpretation of relative abundances can provide spurious results (see [the differential abundance analysis introduction](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/tutorials/gneiss/). One solution to this problem is to use a compositional distance metric such as Aitchison distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a toy example let’s build three taxa. These three taxa represent common distributions we see in microbiome datasets. Where the first taxon is increasing exponentially across samples, this is a trend that we would be interested in. However, taxon 2 and 3 have much higher counts and taxon 3 is randomly fluctuating across samples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![T1](img/T1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our distances below we have Euclidean, Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, and Aitchison distances (from left to right). We can see that the abundance based metrics Euclidean and Bray-Curtis are heavily influenced by the abundance of taxon 3 and seem to randomly fluctuate. In the presence/absence metric, Jaccard, we see that the distance saturates to one very quickly. However, in the Aitchison distance we see a linear curve representing taxon 1. The reason the distance is linear is because Aitchison distance relies on log transforms (the log of an exponential taxon 1 is linear). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![T2](img/T2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From this toy example, it is clear that Aitchison distance better accounts for the proportions. However, we made the unrealistic assumption in our toy example that there were no zero counts. In real microbiome datasets there are a large number of zeros (i.e. sparsity). Sparsity complicates log ratio transformations because the log-ratio of zero is undefined. To solve this pseudo counts, that can skew results, are commonly used (see [Naught all zeros in sequence count data are the same](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/477794v1)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Robust Aitchison PCA solves this problem in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tCompostional preprocessing using the centered log ratio transform on only the non-zero values of the data (no pseudo count)\n",
    "2.\tDimensionality reduction through PCA on only the non-zero values of the data (via [SVD]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) by [matrix completion]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.2027.pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this in action we will run an example dataset below, where the output can be viewed as a compositional biplot through emperor. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will Robust Aitchison PCA via q2-deicode on a study of sleep apnea published in [Tripathi et al. (2018)](https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/3/e00020-18). The study consists of mouse fecal samples and focuses on comparing the gut microbiome of animals exposed to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHH; as a model of obstructive sleep apnea) to controls exposed to room air (air). \n",
