def assert_deicode_ordinationresults_equal(o1, o2, precision=5, verbose=False):
    """Asserts rough equality of OrdinationResults objects produced by DEICODE.

    Parameters
    ----------
        o1: skbio.OrdinationResults
        o2: skbio.OrdinationResults
            The values of these two objects will be compared.
            The following guidelines are followed when comparing o1.features
            and o2.features, and when comparing o1.samples and o2.samples:

                -The index names must be equal, but they can be in any order
                 (they'll be sorted before we compare the DataFrames). However,
                 it is NOT OK for these indices to contain repeated index
                 names; if this is the case, this function will fail.

                -The number of columns must be the same, but their names don't
                 matter.

                -For each column (aka pandas Series) within the DataFrames, we
                 run the pandas.testing.assert_series_equal() function (so
                 o1.features' first column is compared with o2.features' first
                 column, and so on). This function is called with
                 check_names=False (since we allow column names to be
                 different) and check_less_precise=[precision] (where
                 [precision] is the optional argument to this function
                 described below). We also wrap this invocation within a
                 try/except block, to allow for the following:

                -If the first invocation of assert_series_equal() fails between
                 two columns, we try calling it again with one of the columns
                 negated. This is because negating an entire axis in an
                 ordination doesn't really change the interpretation; see
                 @cameronmartino's comments on PR #29 in the biocore/DEICODE
                 repo for a better explanation of this.

        precision: int
            The argument to be passed to pandas.testing.assert_series_equal()
            when comparing the columns within o1 and o2's feature and sample
            DataFrames.

        verbose: bool
            If True, will print some information as this goes through the
